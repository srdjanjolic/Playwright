##  Challenges Faced

1. **Dynamic Selectors** - Elements had changing attributes, so stable selectors were used.  
2. **Session Handling** - Ensured test stability by using fresh login sessions.  
3. **CAPTCHA Issues** - If encountered, manual intervention might be required.  
4. **Date Picker Issues** - The date picker component was difficult to interact with as it required multiple steps to open and select a date.  
5. **Missing Valid Selectors** - Many elements did not have valid `id` attributes or unique selectors, requiring alternative ways like `data-cy`, `XPath`, or text-based locators.
